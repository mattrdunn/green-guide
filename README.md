# Green Guide

## Overview
Green Guide is a web app designed to answer every question a doting plant parent might ask. Whether youâ€™re a complete novice or a seasoned horticulturist, Green Guide offers highly detailed information on a wide range of plant species. The app provides a simple, intuitive user interface to a vast encyclopedia of plant knowledge.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
