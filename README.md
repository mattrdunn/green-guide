# PlantDaddy

## Overview
PlantPedia (name tbd) is a site to organize every all the answers to every unanswered question that a doting plant parent may ask.

## Functional Requirements
The functional requirements for the project will define the various **features** and **abilities** offered to users of the site. The follow is a non-comprehensive list of features that will be provided.
- Search plants by name
- Browse a glossary of plants by name (and image?)
- Create an account?
  - Saved/Favorites section for plants that a user continually wants to look up.
  - History of products that the user has ordered / wants to reorder.


## Non-functional Requirements
The non-functional requirements define the **details** and **constraints** under which the various aspects of the site are provided/performed.
- Capital. Ultimately the site will require a certain amount of funding to be made accessible to a remotely sizeable user base. We should define ways in which funding can be acquired here:
  - Donations. A section where generous users can offer contributions via credit card, PayPal, crypto, etc.
  - Sponsored products recommended to users based on which section(s) they are looking at (e.g. recommended hydroponic fertilizers for users researching semi-hydro).
  - ???
- Accessibility
  - Users may access the site without any account or authentication. We want users to be able easily come through the site without headaches.
  - Quick page loads, fast response time on queries.
  - No obnoxious ads being forced in your face at every turn. If we offer sponsored products, we should present them in a way that feels like an intelligent/personal recommendation, so it's more likely to be appreciated versus cursed (e.g. in information text blocks, adding hyperlinks within explanations of fertilizer that link to certain products).
- Security
  - SSL (HTTPS) protocol for client/server connection.
  - Password Salting for storing user account credentials.
  - Compliance with GDPR standards
  - Explanative, non-predatory Cookie policy & settings dialogue.
